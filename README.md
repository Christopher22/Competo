# Competo
Another easy, tactical and funny game for your browser.

## The game
Two players place their six pawns in a centered and rotated by 90 degrees row on the board. One of them starts, then they perform alternately one of the following moves. At no point, two pawns may be on a single field; to such constellations leading moves are not valid.

- Move a pawn a field towards the finish.
- Move a pawn two fields towards the finish if the pawn is framed directly from own pawns on both sides.
- Move a pawn two fields over an opponent's pawn moving them a field in the direction of its finish, too. Then the player is allowed to make a move again.

The winner is the player who has placed as first all its six pawns on the opposite side of his start.
